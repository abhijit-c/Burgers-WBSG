  abstract  = "This paper is concerned with generalized polynomial chaos (gPC)
               approximation for first-order quasilinear hyperbolic systems
               with uncertainty. The one-dimensional (1D) hyperbolic system is
               first symmetrized with the aid of left eigenvector matrix of the
               Jacobian matrix. Then the gPC stochastic Galerkin method is
               applied to derive a provably symmetrically hyperbolic equations
               for the gPC expansion coefficients. The resulting deterministic
               gPC Galerkin system is discretized by a path-conservative finite
               volume WENO scheme in space and a third-order total variation
               diminishing Runge--Kutta method in time. The method is further
               extended to two-dimensional (2D) quasilinear hyperbolic system
               with uncertainty, where the symmetric hyperbolicity of the
               one-dimensional gPC Galerkin system is carried over via an
               operator splitting technique. Several numerical experiments are
               conducted to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the
               proposed gPC stochastic Galerkin method.",
