# Burgers-WBSG
An reimplementation of a well-balanced stochastic Galerkin method for an
inviscid Burgers equation with random inputs. Methodology based off of the paper
by Jin, Xiu, and Zhu[^1].

## Note to Dr. Chertock

The Github containing all of the work done in the project can be [found
here](https://github.com/abhijit-c/burgers-wbsg). The code in this .zip is
written in Julia and is the 'official' version of it; you'll need the associated
toolchain to run it. [You can find it here](https://julialang.org/).  If instead
you want the MATLAB proof-of-concept code we wrote, that can be found through
the Github link, but frankly it's not very well documented or performant.

Thanks for the class!
